# Create Accounts
You don't have to use the easy sign-up API if you are only trying to create an account for a end user. 

In this guide, you will learn:
- How to create an account by the account API.

## Step 1. Generate an OAuth token
See [Create an OAuth token](1-authentication.md) for details.

## Step 2. Create new subscription by API
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://rest.zuora.com/v1/accounts' \
--header 'zuora: <>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer f57342a3f39e4c1e9ee8ecd06a53dd40' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "additionalEmailAddresses": [
    "contact1@example.com",
    "contact2@example.com"
  ],
  "autoPay": false,
  "billCycleDay": 0,
  "billToContact": {
    "address1": "1051 E Hillsdale Blvd",
    "city": "Foster City",
    "country": "United States",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "state": "CA",
    "workEmail": "smith@example.com",
    "zipCode": "94404"
  },
  "currency": "USD",
  "name": "Zuora Test Account",
  "notes": "This account is for demo purposes."
}'
```
If you don't sepcific the sold-to contact info, then Zuorea will set it the same as the bill-to contact automatically.

## Step 3. Verify the result
After the process is done, you can verify the result in the Zuora UI or through the GET API operations for the Account object.
To verify the result through the Zuora UI, you can find the account you just created displayed at the top of the All Accounts page by navigating to Customers > Accounts in the Zuora UI.
To verify the result through the API, See [Retrieve Object Info](9-retrieve-object-info.md) for details.
